This repo contains 2 different versions of "alien invasion", as
presented in the book "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes.  I used
the book to teach python to some high school students, and we decided
to build the 2 versions of the game, one with a "Star Wars" theme,
and the other with a "Hunger Games" theme.

These games use python 3.7 and the pygame module.
